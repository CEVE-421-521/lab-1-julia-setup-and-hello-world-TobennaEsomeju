## Overview

Welcome to CEVE 421/521!
This lab will guide you through setting up the software tools we'll use throughout the semester.
By the end of this lab, you'll have a working Julia environment and will create your first visualization.


## Pre-Lab Requirements

Complete these steps **before** coming to lab.
Budget 30-60 minutes for installation.
If you get stuck, note where you stopped and we'll troubleshoot in class.

### Create a GitHub Account

If you don't already have one, create a free account at [github.com](https://github.com).
Use your Rice email to get access to additional student benefits.

### Accept the GitHub Classroom Assignment

1. Go to Canvas and find the Lab 1 assignment
2. Click the GitHub Classroom link
3. Accept the assignment to create your personal repository
4. You'll get a link to your new repo (e.g., `CEVE-421-521/lab-01-S26-yourname`)

### Install GitHub Desktop

Download and install [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/).
This provides a visual interface for Git operations.

::: {.callout-tip}
Experienced users can use the command line or another Git client, but GitHub Desktop is recommended for this course.
:::

### Clone Your Repository

1. Open GitHub Desktop
2. Click "Clone a repository from the Internet"
3. Find your lab repository under your GitHub account
4. **Important**: Choose a local path that is NOT in OneDrive, Google Drive, iCloud, or any synced folder
   - Recommended: Create a folder like `~/CEVE-421-521/` and clone into it
   - Your path should be something like `~/CEVE-421-521/lab-01-S26-yourname`

::: {.callout-warning}
Cloud sync services (OneDrive, Google Drive, Dropbox) can corrupt Git repositories.
Always store code repositories in a non-synced folder.
:::

### Install Visual Studio Code

Download and install [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
Then install the Julia extension:

1. Open VS Code
2. Click the Extensions icon in the left sidebar (or press `Ctrl+Shift+X` / `Cmd+Shift+X`)
3. Search for "Julia"
4. Install the "Julia" extension by julialang

### Install Julia via Juliaup

We use [Juliaup](https://github.com/JuliaLang/juliaup) to manage Julia installations.

**Windows:**
Open PowerShell and run:

```powershell
winget install julia -s msstore
```

**macOS/Linux:**
Open Terminal and run:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://install.julialang.org | sh
```

After installation, set Julia 1.12 as the default:

```bash
juliaup add 1.12
juliaup default 1.12
```

Verify your installation by opening a new terminal and running:

```bash
julia --version
```

You should see `julia version 1.12.x`.

::: {.callout-tip}
## CEVE 543 Students

We used Julia 1.11 in CEVE 543 last semester.
If you don't install version 1.12 here, you'll run into errors later.
:::

### Install Quarto

Download and install [Quarto](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/).
This is the document rendering system we use for labs.

Verify installation:

```bash
quarto --version
```

### Set Up GitHub Copilot (Optional but Recommended)

GitHub Copilot is an AI coding assistant that can help you write code.
Students get free access:

1. Apply for the [GitHub Student Developer Pack](https://education.github.com/pack)
2. Once approved, install the "GitHub Copilot" extension in VS Code
3. Sign in with your GitHub account

You are also welcome to explore other AI coding tools such as Claude Code and OpenAI Codex, but these generally have no, or limited, free plans.

### Activate the Julia Environment

1. Open your cloned lab folder in VS Code. You can do this directly from GitHub desktop.
2. Open the VS Code terminal (`Ctrl+`` ` or `Cmd+`` `)
3. Start Julia by typing `julia`
4. Activate and instantiate the project:

```julia
using Pkg
Pkg.activate(".")
Pkg.instantiate()
```

This installs all required packages for the lab.

### Verify Your Setup

In VS Code, open the terminal and run:

```bash
quarto render index.qmd
```

This should produce two files:

- `index.html` (web version)
- `index.pdf` (PDF version via Typst)

If both files are created without errors, your setup is complete!

## In-Class Workflow

Now that your environment is set up, let's complete the lab exercises.

### Setup

This section loads the tools (called "packages") we need for this lab.

```{julia}
#| output: false
if !isfile("Manifest.toml") # <1>
    using Pkg # <2>
    Pkg.instantiate() # <3>
end # <4>
```

1. Check if a file called `Manifest.toml` exists in the current folder. This file tracks which package versions are installed.
2. Load Julia's built-in package manager, called `Pkg`.
3. Install all packages listed in `Project.toml`. This only runs if `Manifest.toml` doesn't exist yet.
4. `end` closes the `if` block. Julia uses `if ... end` instead of curly braces like some other languages.

We'll load a popular plotting library

```{julia}
#| output: false
using CairoMakie # <1>
```

1. Load the CairoMakie package, which we'll use to create plots. `using` makes all the functions from that package available.

### Exercises

#### Exercise 1: Identify Yourself

Fill in your name, NetID, and GitHub username below.
In Julia, we store values in **variables** using the `=` sign.

```{julia}
name = "James Doss-Gollin" # <1>
netid = "jd82" # <2>
github_username = "jdossgollin" # <3>
```

1. Create a variable called `name` and assign it a **string** (text in quotes). Replace with your name!
2. Create another variable called `netid`. Strings can use either double quotes `"..."` or single quotes `'...'`.
3. Your GitHub username is what appears in your repository URL (e.g., `github.com/jdossgollin`).

Now, Quarto will automatically print a greeting using **string interpolation**:

```{julia}
println("Hello! My name is $name and my NetID is $netid.") # <1>
```

1. `println()` prints text to the screen. The `$` symbol inside a string inserts the value of a variable. This is called **string interpolation** - Julia replaces `$name` with the actual value stored in `name`.

#### Exercise 2: Generate Data

Let's create some data to visualize.
We'll generate a noisy sine wave - this simulates real-world data that has measurement error.

```{julia}
#| output: false
x = range(0, 2pi, length=50) # <1>
noise = 0.3 * randn(length(x)) # <2>
y_noisy = sin.(x) .+ noise # <3>
y_true = sin.(x) # <4>
```

1. Create 50 evenly-spaced numbers from 0 to 2π (about 6.28). `range()` is like making tick marks on a ruler. `pi` is a built-in constant in Julia.
2. Generate random "noise" values. `randn(n)` creates `n` random numbers from a normal distribution (bell curve centered at 0). `length(x)` returns how many elements are in `x` (50). Multiplying by 0.3 makes the noise smaller.
3. Calculate noisy y-values. The **dot** `.` before `sin` and `+` means "apply this operation to **each element**" - this is called **broadcasting**. Without the dot, Julia would try to take the sine of the whole array at once (which doesn't work). So `sin.(x)` computes sine for all 50 x-values.
4. Calculate the "true" sine values without noise, for comparison.


#### Exercise 3: Create a Visualization

Now let's plot the noisy data alongside the true sine function.
CairoMakie uses a "grammar of graphics" approach: you build plots layer by layer.

```{julia}
#| label: fig-sine
#| fig-cap: "Noisy sine wave data with true function overlay"
let # <1>
    fig = Figure() # <2>
    ax = Axis(fig[1, 1]; xlabel="x", ylabel="y", title="Noisy Sine Wave") # <3>
    scatter!(ax, x, y_noisy; label="Noisy data", markersize=8) # <4>
    lines!(ax, x, y_true; linestyle=:dash, linewidth=2, label="True function") # <5>
    axislegend(ax) # <6>
    fig # <7>
end # <1>
```

1. `let ... end` creates a temporary scope. Variables created inside (like `fig` and `ax`) won't clutter your workspace. This is a good habit for plotting code.
2. Create an empty figure - think of it as a blank canvas to draw on.
3. Add an axis (the plotting area with x/y coordinates) to the figure. `fig[1, 1]` means "row 1, column 1" of a grid layout. The semicolon `;` separates positional arguments from **keyword arguments** like `xlabel=`, `ylabel=`, and `title=`.
4. Add scattered points. The `!` at the end of `scatter!` is a Julia convention meaning "this function modifies something" (here, it adds to the axis). We pass the axis, x-coordinates, y-coordinates, and styling options.
5. Add a dashed line for the true function. `:dash` is a **symbol** - a special Julia type for named options (look up "Julia symbols" for more).
6. Add a legend that automatically uses the `label` text from each plot layer.
7. Return the figure so it displays. In Julia, the last expression in a block is automatically returned.

## Submission

Follow these steps to submit your completed lab:

### Push to GitHub

In GitHub Desktop:

1. Review your changes in the "Changes" tab
2. Write a summary (e.g., "Complete Lab 1 exercises")
3. Click "Commit to main"
4. Click "Push origin" to upload to GitHub

### Handle the Formatter PR

After you push, a GitHub Action will check your code formatting.
If any changes are needed:

1. Go to your repository on GitHub
2. Look for a Pull Request titled "Format Julia code"
3. If one exists, click "Merge pull request" and confirm

### Pull Changes to Your Computer

After merging the formatter PR (or if there was no PR), you need to sync your local copy:

1. Open GitHub Desktop
2. Click "Fetch origin" in the top bar (this checks for remote changes)
3. If changes are found, click "Pull origin" to download them
4. Your local files are now up to date with GitHub

::: {.callout-tip}
Always pull before you start working and after merging any PRs.
This keeps your local copy in sync with GitHub.
:::

### Re-render and Submit

After pulling any changes:

```bash
quarto render index.qmd
```

Upload the generated `index.pdf` file to the Lab 1 assignment on Canvas.

## Summary

In this lab, you:

- Set up a complete Julia development environment
- Learned the lab workflow: clone → code → push → merge PR → render → submit
- Created your first Julia visualization using CairoMakie

This workflow will be the same for all labs this semester.
If you have any issues, come to office hours or post on the discussion board.
